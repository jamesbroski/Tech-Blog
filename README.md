# Tech-Blog

In this activity, we were tasked to write a full-stack application regarding a Tech-Blog

The user is able to interact with the application with a bunch of cool features.

The user is able to signup, login, create a new post, view all of the posts, comment on existing posts, delete posts, and logout. 

The structure of this application followed a MVC layout (Model, View, Controllers)

I utilized express, handlebars, sequelize, and mySQL as the main libraries/frameworks to help build this application.

The deployed link for the applicaation can be found here: https://hidden-harbor-54939.herokuapp.com/

Below is a screenshot of what the user can expect to see:![Screen Shot 2021-09-27 at 8 37 45 PM (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87332492/135015021-cc833b94-4dfa-4bed-b6c1-f3e7a24a3a71.png)
